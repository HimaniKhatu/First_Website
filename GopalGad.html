            <p>Gopalgad, also known as Anjanvel Fort, is a historic coastal fort located near the village of Anjanvel in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, India. Built in the 16th century by the Siddi rulers 
                of the Bijapur Sultanate, it later came under the control of the Marathas and eventually the British during colonial rule. The fort is strategically situated on a hill, offering panoramic views of 
                the Arabian Sea and surrounding countryside, making it both a defensive stronghold and a scenic location. Though now in ruins, Gopalgad remains a popular site for trekkers and history enthusiasts 
                who are drawn to its rugged charm and historical significance.It features a classical spire and is situated near the historic Ponda Fort, which has witnessed several battles and changes in control over the centuries.</p>

            <p>The Anjanvel Lighthouse, located near Guhagar in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district, is an important historical and maritime landmark perched on Anjanvel Hill. Established in the 18th 
                century, this lighthouse serves as a vital navigational aid for ships traveling along the western coast of India. Standing at a height of about 10 meters, the cylindrical masonry 
                tower emits a flashing light that helps guide vessels safely through the Arabian Sea. The lighthouse offers stunning panoramic views of the surrounding coastline and lush Konkan 
                landscapes, making it a popular spot for tourists. Visitors can trek up the hill to reach the lighthouse, and the route itself offers a scenic experience, especially in the 
                post-monsoon months. While the lighthouse is operational year-round, the best time to visit is from October to March when the weather is more favorable.</p>
